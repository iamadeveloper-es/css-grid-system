# CSS Grid System

Basic CSS reset and grid.
This is more than a CSS reset, a grid system ready to use based on 12 columns grid using flexbox.

## Description

Every time I start a new project I need to perform a series of global styles and reset certain HTML elements.
I don't want to depend on more unnecessary libraries than I will only use a small part of the code.
With these styles I intend to only have a basic starting CSS nothing more and nothing less.
If you want to use it forward, I hope it helps you.
